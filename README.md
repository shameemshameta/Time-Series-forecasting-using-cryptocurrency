## Introduction
------------

Cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin have gained significant attention in recent years. Understanding their price movements and forecasting future trends is of great interest to investors and analysts. This project utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, and pmdarima for time series analysis and forecasting.

## Dependencies
------------

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

*   Python 3
*   Pandas
*   NumPy
*   Seaborn
*   Matplotlib
*   Statsmodels
*   pmdarima
*   scikit-learn

# You can install these dependencies using pip:


```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib statsmodels pmdarima scikit-learn
```

Usage: Clone this repository to your local machine:
-----


### git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory

git clone <repository-url>
```

Usage: Clone this repository to your local machine:
-----

```bash
cd Dogecoin-Time-Series-Analysis
```

Usage : Navigate to the project directory:
-----

* 1.Ensure your dataset (coin_Dogecoin.csv) is in the project directory.
